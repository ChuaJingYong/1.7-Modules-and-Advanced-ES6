### **Challenge - Summing Total Order Amount**

In this challenge, you'll create a program that calculates the total amount for a customer's order by summing up individual item prices. Youâ€™ll practice using a `for` loop to iterate through an array of prices and calculate the total amount.

### **Scenario**

Youâ€™ll be writing a program that:

1. **Takes an array of item prices** representing a customerâ€™s order.
2. **Uses a `for` loop** to iterate through the array and sum up the total amount.
3. **Returns the total** once all prices are added up.

### **Starter Function**

```js
function calculateTotalOrderAmount(prices) {
    // Define your logic here
}
```

### **Example Inputs and Outputs**

```js
// == Example 1 ==
// Input: [10, 25, 40, 15]
// Output: "The total order amount is $90"

// == Example 2 ==
// Input: [5, 8, 12]
// Output: "The total order amount is $25"
```

### ðŸ§  **Hints**

For the best learning experience, try solving the challenge using just the requirements and understanding the inputs and outputs. Refer to the hints only if needed.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Start by defining a variable to hold the total amount and initialize it to 0.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Use a `for` loop to go through each price in the array and add it to the total.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Make sure to return the total after the loop finishes.

### **Pseudocode Solution**

<details>
<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

```
1. Define a function that accepts an array of prices.

2. Inside the function:
    a. Initialize a variable named totalAmount to 0.
    b. Use a for loop to iterate over the prices array.
    c. Add each price to totalAmount during each iteration of the loop.

3. After the loop, return the totalAmount.

4. Display the total amount using console.log().
```
